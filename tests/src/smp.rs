//! In-QEMU test kernel for SMP: per-CPU state, a kernel spinlock, and
//! secondary-core bring-up (docs/SMP.md, task #27).
//!
//! This is **opt-in** SMP: it exercises `kernel::smp` on the primary CPU (the
//! spinlock + the per-CPU registry, which must work single-core with zero fuss),
//! then asks the arch layer to start one secondary core. The honest per-ISA
//! outcome (docs/SMP.md):
//!   - RISC-V: a genuine second hart runs kernel code (SBI HSM `hart_start`).
//!   - x86-64: a genuine second core runs kernel code (a real-mode AP trampoline
//!     staged in low memory, released by INIT-SIPI-SIPI through the local APIC's
//!     interrupt command register - docs/SMP.md 6).
//!   - ARM64: bring-up is blocked in this QEMU config (PSCI `CPU_ON` needs EL3
//!     firmware that `virt` without `secure=on` does not have); the test makes a
//!     genuine, guarded attempt, prints skip-with-reason, and still PASSES
//!     (mirroring how librheonet/librheogpu skip when a device is absent).
//!
//! Where a secondary does come up, the assertions are chosen to be unfakeable by
//! the primary (docs/ENGINEERING.md 1): the shared counter carries a fixed magic
//! written only from `smp::secondary_run`, the registry slot is one the primary
//! never claims, and the secondary's recorded hardware id must **differ** from the
//! boot CPU's - a primary looping back through the same code could satisfy none of
//! the three.
//!
//! Either way the primary never hangs (the bring-up wait is bounded) and never
//! faults - a blocked ISA keeps single-core boot intact.
