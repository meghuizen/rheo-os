//! The user-mode run loop and syscall dispatch (BUILD-ORDER.md step 5).
//! Portable: the arch trampolines save/restore U-mode state and call
//! `on_user_trap`; this module owns the policy - which cell is current,
//! what each syscall does, and how a cell's run ends.
//!
//! Cross-cell switching (`SYS_SWITCH`) is a directed hand-off between two
//! user cells with a real address-space switch each way - the mechanism
//! the P5 benchmark measures against seL4's cross-vspace IPC.
//!
//! Global mutable state with raw pointers is deliberate here: this is the
//! per-CPU scheduler, there is one CPU at this stage, and traps are
//! synchronous, so there is no concurrent access to guard against.
